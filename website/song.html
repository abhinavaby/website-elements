            Left over
            Some best vocals to let them off of my head
            I'm on my metamorphosis to best
            I focus like I'm threading a needle with my rhymes
            I'm peeing with precise aim from the heights
            It's hitting the water closet
            You picking the fight and you losing
            You thinking you pirate class
            You think you got pyroclastic flow
            You need private class from me
            You just a fiber glass without a core, or pore to sweat
            You say you coldest with a flow full of holes loaded
            You got them hoes all over the scene
            You see profit it in flex
            You five foot or less
            You sound like a midget wanna grow, no offense
            I sound like the F word inside your fence
            That's fear or family, you can decide what I'm in
            I say you leave me to myself and my family and let me write my songs
