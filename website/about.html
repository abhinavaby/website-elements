Abel Jose lives a life of quiet intensity,
perpetually in pursuit of the ghosts of the past. 
Driven by a childhood tragedy and an heirloom compass,
he seeks to honor his family's legacy by completing his grandfather's work.
He is a man at odds with a world that values data over dreams and lives by the quote,
"It is impossible to fail if you gave it your all; if you still fail, it means you never gave it your all".</pre>
